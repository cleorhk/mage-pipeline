Mage Data Pipeline with PostgreSQL
This project demonstrates the setup of a data pipeline using Mage, Docker, and PostgreSQL. The pipeline extracts, transforms, and loads (ETL) data using Mage, a modern data orchestration tool. The infrastructure is containerized with Docker and managed using Docker Compose.

Project Overview
The project includes:

Mage: A data orchestration tool used to define and run data pipelines.
PostgreSQL: A relational database used for storing and querying data.
Docker: Containerization of the application for consistent environments and easy deployment.
Docker Compose: Simplifies multi-container Docker applications, enabling easy management of services.
Features
Data Pipeline with Mage: Easily define and run ETL pipelines.
PostgreSQL Integration: Seamlessly connect to a PostgreSQL database for data storage and querying.
Dockerized Setup: Containerized environment ensures consistency across different development and production environments.
Environment Variables: Configuration using environment variables for flexibility and security.
